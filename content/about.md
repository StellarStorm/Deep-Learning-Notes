## What is this?

At the moment, this is essentially my deep learning notebook. It's formatted
something like a blog to make organizations easier, but I doubt this will
become a "blog" in any real sense - posts will change and be updated as I gain
experience and find errors.
The hope is to have a unified location where I keep everything I've learned
(with consistent formatting!)

This is very much an opinionated collection of information and should be
treated as such! I have almost no formal training in computer science or
programming (I have a physics degree) and everything I've learned has been in
either in the context of my hobbies or work. Specifically, my deep learning
experience is in the context of auto-contouring medical images to be used in
a cancer treatment pipeline. As such, I'm not able to run comprehensive
experiments on many different datasets; I just tend to learn things that work
"for me" but might not in other contexts.

This is also just an experiment in using Hugo and GitHub pages!

## Who am I?

I'm Skylar.
I graduated from [Houston Baptist University](https://hbu.edu/) with a B.S. in
physics in 2020 and am headed to the PhD medical physics program at the
[MD Anderson Cancer Center UTHealth Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences](https://gsbs.uth.edu/medphys/).

Check out the awesome [research group](https://www.mdanderson.org/research/departments-labs-institutes/labs/court-laboratory.html)
that I've been working with since 2016! Our primary project is the
[Radiation Planning Assistant (RPA)](https://rpa.mdanderson.org/), an intiative
to leverage deep learning to provide fully-automated radiation planning for
cancer patients worldwide.
