All code examples below are simply psuedo-code that has been simplified for clarity. For actual loss functions, RadIO has ready-to-go examples under the Apache 2.0 license.
Left: Intersection of two sets. Right: Union of two sets [1]
Jaccard The Jaccard index, also called IoU (Intersection over Union), is perhaps one of the easiest metrics to visualize.</description></item></channel></rss>
