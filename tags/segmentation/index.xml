The goal was to downsample the input image and segmentation maps on the fly once they&amp;rsquo;re fed into the model during training, in order to (a) effectively increase the receptive fields of the kernels, but mostly to (b) fit more data per batch into a GPU that likes to run out of memory.
A simple downsampling operation is just to call tf.</description></item><item><title>Region-Overlap Metrics/Losses</title><link>https://stellarstorm.github.io/Deep-Learning-Notes/post/region_loss/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://stellarstorm.github.io/Deep-Learning-Notes/post/region_loss/</guid><description>Overlap metrics of two regions are excellent ways to quantify how well a model is able to predict segmentation mappings.
All code examples below are simply psuedo-code that has been simplified for clarity. For actual loss functions, RadIO has ready-to-go examples under the Apache 2.0 license.
Left: Intersection of two sets. Right: Union of two sets [1]
Jaccard The Jaccard index, also called IoU (Intersection over Union), is perhaps one of the easiest metrics to visualize.</description></item></channel></rss>
