This machine has been in our lab for many years and has been instrumental in our research in fully-automated radiotherapy planning. However, it hasn&amp;rsquo;t been updated in a long time. Still running the original DGXOS 3 (Ubuntu 16.04) and CUDA libraries, it didn&amp;rsquo;t support our TensorFlow 2 Docker or Singularity images.
The Nvidia documentation is rather good in listing the steps needed and possible conflicts during the upgrade process.</description></item></channel></rss>
